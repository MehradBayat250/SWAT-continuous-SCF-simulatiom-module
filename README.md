Although SCF is an effective variable for snow simulation, original SWAT only calculates this variable for days in which the snowmelt process is triggered by daily mean temperature when is raised above the temperature threshold, i.e. SMTMP parameter. Moreover, for days in which the snowmelt process is not activated, i.e. days with snow accumulation, the model does not calculate the SCF value.
