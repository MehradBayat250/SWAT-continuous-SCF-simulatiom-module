Although SCF is an effective variable for snow simulation, original SWAT only calculates this variable for days in which the snowmelt process is triggered by daily mean temperature when is raised above the temperature threshold, i.e. SMTMP parameter. Moreover, for days in which the snowmelt process is not activated, i.e. days with snow accumulation, the model does not calculate the SCF value. Moreover, the model simulates the snow processes at the HRU scale, while considers the snow parameters at the (sub)basin scale (e.g. SMTMP, SFTMP, SMFMN, SMFMX, and TIMP) or whole basin scale (e.g. SNOCOVMX and SNO50COV). Therefore, there is a mismatch between the spatial scale of the snow parameters and the modelâ€™s equations related to snow processes.
